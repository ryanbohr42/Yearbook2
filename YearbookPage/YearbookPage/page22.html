            An event plagued by rain the year before, this year’s Student
            Council Carnival was again threatened to be reluctantly
            moved indoors. But luckily the weather cooperated and the
            event was held out on the front lawn. “This was the first
            year the carnival was outside - we tried to do it outside
            last year but it rained. I think it went really well. We were
            contemplating on moving it inside but then we wouldn’t
            have been able to tie dye and have some of the inflatables,”
            said Rachel Kolb (‘16), a co-chair of the event.
            Made enjoyable by the inclusion of most of the clubs,
            students were able to walk from booth to booth and
            participate in activities put on by their fellow students.
            Jessica Olson (‘18) remembered “activities like dunking
            teachers in a tank, tie-dye, live music, and they gave away
            cotton candy and it was actually pretty good.” Evident by the
            line of students spanning across the parking lot, the free
            cotton candy was a hit with the students.

            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular event was
            the tie-dye spring fling t-shirts hosted by student council.
            “I think tie dying was also a huge success because you
            could create your own shirt and personalize it, also student
            council has never done anything like that before so it was
            different.”
            Just a few booths down was the Red Kettle Club table,
            where club treasurer Lucy Kwiatkowski (‘16) was handing
            out snow cones, “We went with red snow cones because
            it’s red kettle club.” The group was attempting to draw in
            more members, and strangely enough, meeting attendance
            doubled the next week. Continuing, she said “Looking
            back, I just remember that my hands were really cold from
            scooping all the crushed ice.”
