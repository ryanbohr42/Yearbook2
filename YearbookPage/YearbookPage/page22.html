                        An event plagued by rain the year before, this year’s Student
                        Council Carnival was again threatened to be reluctantly
                        moved indoors. But luckily the weather cooperated and the
                        event was held out on the front lawn. “This was the first
                        year the carnival was outside - we tried to do it outside
                        last year but it rained. I think it went really well. We were
                        contemplating on moving it inside but then we wouldn’t
                        have been able to tie dye and have some of the inflatables,”
                        said Rachel Kolb (‘16), a co-chair of the event.
                        <br/>
                            Made enjoyable by the inclusion of most of the clubs,
                        students were able to walk from booth to booth and
                        participate in activities put on by their fellow students.
                        Jessica Olson (‘18) remembered “activities like dunking
                        teachers in a tank, tie-dye, live music, and they gave away
                        cotton candy and it was actually pretty good.” Evident by the
                        line of students spanning across the parking lot, the free
                        cotton candy was a hit with the students.

                        Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular event was
                        the tie-dye spring fling t-shirts hosted by student council.
                        “I think tie dying was also a huge success because you
                        could create your own shirt and personalize it, also student
                        council has never done anything like that before so it was
                        different.”
                        <br />
                        Just a few booths down was the Red Kettle Club table,
                        where club treasurer Lucy Kwiatkowski (‘16) was handing
                        out snow cones, “We went with red snow cones because
                        it’s red kettle club.” The group was attempting to draw in
                        more members, and strangely enough, meeting attendance
                        doubled the next week. Continuing, she said “Looking
                        back, I just remember that my hands were really cold from
                        scooping all the crushed ice.”
