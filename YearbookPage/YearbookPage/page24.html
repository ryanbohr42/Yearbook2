                        money they had raised over the past four years to replace the sound system of
                        the Football field with a newer, higher-quality one. THE LAST SONG The

                        Hilmer (‘15), Jessica Richards (‘15) and Leah Peavler (‘15) sing their last song
                        together as a high school choir. #SELFIE As class president Joey Baker (15’)
                        stands in front of everyone giving his presidential declaration, many giggle and
                        laugh as hundreds of selfies flip in the background. During graduation practice,
                        Joey made a deal with Mr. Gruetzmacher, that if over 50% of the students
                        tweeted a selfie then he would shave his head. Although the class exceeded
                        their 50%, Mr. Gruetzmacher did not shave his head.

                    Waking up on graduation day is terrifying. Every senior knows that it’s
                    the last day that he or she will ever be considered a high school student.
                    After 7 years of seeing the same people, it’s daunting to think that
                    graduation day is the last time the entire class of 2015 will be together,
                    in the same room, in the same school. No matter how excited each
                    person is to graduate and move on to bigger things, no one can help but
                    feel a twinge of nostalgia the moment they enter the gym and realize
                    that this - this understated gathering of parents in folding chairs and
                    students in robes - is the end.
                    “Waking up every morning and getting to spend eight hours a day
                    with the people you love is something I will always cherish,” Michael
                    Dobrzynski (‘15) recalled. “All of my friends... can’t believe how many
                    memories we made.”
                    When thinking back on graduation day, Grace Dunn (‘15)
                    commented, “It was over. It was great to spend one last day with
                    everyone, but then I realized. Seeing each other everyday? That
                    wouldn’t happen anymore and it was sad.”
                    After all, graduation day is the day that seniors become freshmen,
                    high schoolers become college kids. “It was sad to think that at the
                    end of the summer, I would be saying goodbye to everyone. I’ve been
                    friends some people since second grade, and I watched them go off and
                    start their new lives,” remembered Kaitlyn Peksa (‘15).
                    Graduation day was the last day when the Class of 2015 were
                    still seniors. It was the last time they would sit together as Brookfield
                    Central students, as high schoolers. When the day was done, they
                    would predict their future, see themselves moving on, and say goodbye
                    to high school forever.
