    After qualifying for state in the 2014, the Brookfield Central
    Boys golf team took a huge hit, losing 60 percent of their
    starting lineup. The only returning members were Sean
    Yun (‘16) and Josh Trasser (‘16). The three vacant spots in the
    lineup were filled up by Kevin Hershberger (‘16), Brandon
    Talaska (‘17), and Zach Mindel (‘18). Even with the huge
    change, the boys began the season with the same goals as
    the previous year: win conference, qualify for state, and be
    successful.
    The future of the team might have looked bleak to most,
    but Yun never doubted them. “We had many guys from last
    year’s reserve team that were ready to play,” He said. Talaska
    agreed, “I was so motivated to work my heart out and
    improve, as did everyone else.”
    With this attitude, the team approached every
    opportunity as positively as it could. Even though the boys
    did not meet the first two goals on the list, they were still
    able to achieve the third. They might not have placed first
    in the GMC, but all of the athletes achieved new personal
    bests in their high school careers. Talaska had a 39 at the
    3rd Conference mini-meet, Mindel an 83 at sectionals,
    Hershberger a 79 at regionals, and Yun a 74 at the Waukesha
    County Championship. They might not have qualified for
    
    state, but they sent Trasser, who, after shooting his career-
    best 76 at sectionals, moved on as an individual. He finished
    
    the season ranked 21st in the Wisconsin.
    Looking back, Yun and Talaska were not disappointed.
    Yun explained, “Although struggled, we are proud of our
    season. We worked hard and will continue to work hard and
    even better next year.”</p>
