<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    After qualifying for state in the 2014, the Brookfield Central <br/>
    Boys golf team took a huge hit, losing 60 percent of their  <br/>
    starting lineup. The only returning members were Sean  <br/>
    Yun (‘16) and Josh Trasser (‘16). The three vacant spots in the  <br/>
    lineup were filled up by Kevin Hershberger (‘16), Brandon  <br/>
    Talaska (‘17), and Zach Mindel (‘18). Even with the huge  <br/>
    change, the boys began the season with the same goals as  <br/>
    the previous year: win conference, qualify for state, and be  <br/>
    successful.  <br/>
    The future of the team might have looked bleak to most,  <br/>
    but Yun never doubted them. “We had many guys from last <br/>
    year’s reserve team that were ready to play,” He said. Talaska  <br/>
    agreed, “I was so motivated to work my heart out and  <br/>
    improve, as did everyone else.” <br/>
    With this attitude, the team approached every  <br/>
    opportunity as positively as it could. Even though the boys  <br/>
    did not meet the first two goals on the list, they were still  <br/>
    able to achieve the third. They might not have placed first  <br/>
    in the GMC, but all of the athletes achieved new personal  <br/>
    bests in their high school careers. Talaska had a 39 at the  <br/>
    3rd Conference mini-meet, Mindel an 83 at sectionals, <br/>
    Hershberger a 79 at regionals, and Yun a 74 at the Waukesha <br/>
    County Championship. They might not have qualified for <br/>
    state, but they sent Trasser, who, after shooting his career-  <br/>
    best 76 at sectionals, moved on as an individual. He finished  <br/>
    the season ranked 21st in the Wisconsin.  <br/>
    Looking back, Yun and Talaska were not disappointed.  <br/>
    Yun explained, “Although struggled, we are proud of our  <br/>
    season. We worked hard and will continue to work hard and  <br/> 
    even better next year.”</p>
